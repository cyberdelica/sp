.SH SYNOPSIS

[\fB\-hj\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B sp
fetches the latest precious metal spot prices.
The API it uses only updates every 2 minutes, so it is inadvisable to request the data any faster.
.B sp
uses \fBcurl\fR(1), \fBjq\fR(1), and \fBsed\fR(1) within its internal functions, and as such, they are a requirement for \fBsp\fR to run.
.B sp
will automatically check for the appropriate dependencies upon execution.
.PP

.TP
.BR \-m " " \fImetal\fR
The metal to display the price for.
Options are: \fIgold\fR, \fIau\fR, \fIsilver\fR, \fIag\fR, \fIplatinum\fR, \fIpt\fR, \fIpalladium\fR, and \fIpd\fR.

The default unit of weight to display prices for is: \fItroy\fR.
.SH EXAMPLES
.BR sp (1)
can be used to fetch precious metals prices on a periodic basis with a bit of simple shell scripting.
As the API \fBsp\fR(1) uses only updates every 2 minutes, it is not worthwhile requesting data any faster.
To fetch prices every 2 minutes, use:
.PP
.nf
.RS
while :
do
	sp
	sleep 120
done
.RE
.fi
.PP
The results can be redirected to a log file, or piped to a program like \fBawk\fR(1) for further processing.
.SH NOTES
.B sp
uses an undocumented API, therefore it should be considered unstable, and liable to fail at any moment.
Do not use in any situation where the reliability of the program is a requirement.
.SH BUGS
Currently scrapes a web page for an ajax token on every invocation.
As such, it uses more bandwidth than necessary.
In future, the token will be stored in a file, and by various means \fBsp\fR(1) will ascertain whether to scrape another token, or to continue to use the one stored.
